I used the real estate valuation dataset, collected from Sindian District, New Taipei City, Taiwan, to develop a simple linear regression project. I created several basic linear regression models, selected the ones with the best scores, and made predictions for the target column. Then, I generated columns with the variation values from the best algorithms, added them to the dataset, and exported the data as a CSV file. This file was used to create the Power BI dashboard. In the GitHub repository, you will find the Power BI PDFs, the Jupyter Notebook file containing the data preprocessing and machine learning algorithms, and the PBIX file of the dashboard.
